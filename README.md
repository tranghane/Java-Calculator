## Motivation
The project is a great inspiration for me, firstly as an Iphone user and secondly as a mathematics enjoyer. The project 
also require me to be able to not only using mathematical function but also designing a user interface, which is a new
aspect of coding that I have never done before. Lastly, I choose to design a calculator that not only leverage my skills
in Java but also delivery a useful tool that can help a wide range of user.
An example of text with **bold** and *italic* fonts.
